What is the use of break and continue in Python?**\n\n- In Python, **break and continue** statements can alter the flow of a normal loop.\n\n- Loops iterate over a block of code until the test expression is false, but sometimes we wish to terminate the current iteration or even the whole loop without checking test expression.\n\n- The **break and continue** statements are used in these cases.","metadata":{},"id":"f57d3133-c32b-4853-92f8-bf1fc6842c05"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **2. Python break statement**\n\n- The break statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop.\n\n- If the break statement is inside a nested loop (loop inside another loop), the break statement will terminate the innermost loop.","metadata":{},"id":"03c9052d-2699-42c3-8fef-fae335bbfdfa"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Syntax of break**\n\n- *break*","metadata":{},"id":"a8cf3896-6a90-40e3-bdbd-c9e1e017b69f"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Flowchart of break**","metadata":{},"id":"606c4949-abb6-4932-ae74-0a982c7c0a05"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Flowchart of break](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/flowchart-break-statement.jpg)","metadata":{},"id":"e6c33c5e-cd8f-4fa5-998c-d6ee990cbce2"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The working of break statement in for loop and while loop is shown below.","metadata":{},"id":"cedc73cb-e8b4-4b7d-8a32-d870fb0d0b98"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Break statement in for loop](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/how-break-statement-works.jpg)","metadata":{},"id":"729a3b37-1559-4a18-abf6-02e0c6b87fb9"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Example: Python break**","metadata":{},"id":"7aacde63-7de5-44cb-a550-9994283a6d87"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use of break statement inside the loop\n\nfor val in \"string\":\n  if val == \"i\":\n    break\n  print(val)\n\nprint(\"The end\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"s\nt\nr\nThe end\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"4a1bfb49-b44a-4103-b780-0e6bc21d6604"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- In this program, we iterate through the \"string\" sequence.
