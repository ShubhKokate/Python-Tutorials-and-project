What are packages?**\n\n- We don't usually store all of our files on our computer in the same location. We use a well-organized hierarchy of directories for easier access.\n\n- Similar files are kept in the same directory, for example, we may keep all the songs in the **music** directory. Analogous to this, Python has packages for directories and [modules](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/modules) for files.\n\n- As our application program grows larger in size with a lot of modules, we place similar modules in one package and different modules in different packages. This makes a project (program) easy to manage and conceptually clear.\n\n- Similarly, as a directory can contain subdirectories and files, a Python package can have sub-packages and modules.\n\n- A directory must contain a file named `__init__.py` in order for Python to consider it as a package. This file can be left empty but we generally place the initialization code for that package in this file.\n\n- Here is an example. Suppose we are developing a game. One possible organization of packages and modules could be as shown in the figure below.","metadata":{},"id":"21a0feff-52b0-4e9a-a251-72d5ac2a846d"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- **Package Module Structure in Python Programming**\n\n![Package Module Structure in Python Programming](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/PackageModuleStructure.jpg)","metadata":{},"id":"016b53dd-344c-4f88-a26f-d7abc2638d4f"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **2.
