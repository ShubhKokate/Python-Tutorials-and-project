What is pass statement in Python?**\n\n- In Python programming, the pass statement is a null statement. \n\n- The difference between a comment and a pass statement in Python is that while the interpreter ignores a comment entirely, pass is not ignored.\n\n- However, nothing happens when the pass is executed. It results in no operation (NOP).","metadata":{},"id":"917a8efe-f84c-4832-a8fd-b3fe94dfdcdb"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **2.
